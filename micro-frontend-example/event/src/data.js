        "Few animals on earth have the presence of that largest of big cats, the Tiger. When one is nearby, it isn’t just a shiver that goes through your spine; a shiver goes through the spine of the whole animal community. All the nearby deer are a single step from panic, sniffing the air; everything is on high alert. It’s exciting enough to experience this from a jeep – now imagine you are walking around on foot. In Nepal, unlike in India, this is allowed and on this trip you can literally walk in a Tiger’s footsteps. There is a steady-growing population of Tigers in both National Parks we visit on this tour, and much else to see, such as Asian Elephant, Indian Rhinoceros and Gharial.",
